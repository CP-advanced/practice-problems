# welcome to cp-advanced practice problems :)
<strong>what's this?</strong>
a place where we can post & collab on all the practice problems worked on in the advanced course

- feel free to include any files of your code solutions/progress
- ask questions in our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/CP-advanced/teams/observers/discussions">dicussion tab</a> of the team
- all problems covered in the advanced group will be posted in this repo's <a href="https://github.com/CP-advanced/practice-problems/wiki">wiki</a>
- use this to increase your github activity! :)

<strong>posting a solution?</strong>

- navigate to the week where the solution you're posting belongs 
- preface it with your initials (e.g. ap-reverse-linked-list or ap_reverseLinkedList or apReverseLinkedList, or whatever you want) so not all files are named the same
- remember, post any questions/concerns with the code problem in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/CP-advanced/teams/observers/discussions">dicussion tab</a>
- update and delete files as many times as you'd like
- commit your file with a message if you'd like!

<strong>what else?</strong>

- feel free to edit this readme and include anything helpful!
