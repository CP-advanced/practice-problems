# welcome to cp-advanced practice problems :)
<strong>what's this?</strong>
a place where we can post & collab on all the practice problems worked on in the advanced course

- feel free to include any files of your code solutions/progress
- ask questions in the dicussion tab of the group
- all problems covered in the advanced group will be posted <i>in this repo's wiki</i>
- use this to increase your github activity! :)

<strong>posting a solution?</strong>

- preface it with your initials (e.g. ap-reverse-linked-list or ap_reverseLinkedList or apReverseLinkedList, or whatever you want) so not all files are named the same
- post any questions/concerns with the code problem in the discussion tab 
- update and delete files as many times as you'd like

<strong>what else?</strong>

- feel free to edit this readme and include anything helpful!
